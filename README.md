# Outbreak Tracker 2

This is an attempt to rewrite the old C99 Resident Evil Outbreak tracker in C#.

This version will only support PCSX2 version 2.0.0 or later.

> [!Important]
> This project is currently in early alpha version, nothing is set in stone yet, things may change.

# Supported Platforms
- Theoretically anywhere PCSX2 2.0.0+ and .NET9 can run at the same time.
- Practically windows + .NET9 for now.
